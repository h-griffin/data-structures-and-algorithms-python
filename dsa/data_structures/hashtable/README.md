# hashtable

## description & Big O
uses a linked list and a hashmap to store data with an O(1) lookup time, worst case O(N), in regards to collisions, in which two inputs have the same key but different values, these key:value pairs are stored in a linked list at the hashtable index. O(N) is worst case the length of the longest linked list index/bucket.
