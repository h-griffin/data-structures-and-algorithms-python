# Challenge Summary
array binary search

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

Code Challenge
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms.
Create a new branch in your repo called array-binary-search.
Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
On your branch, create…
C#: a new .NET Core console project named BinarySearch. Within your Program.cs create a new static method outside of Main() following the naming conventions below. Call your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named arrayBinarySearch which contains a file called array-binary-search.js
Python: a folder named array_binary_search which contains a file called array_binary_search.py
Java: a file called BinarySearch.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

Example

```Input	Output
[4,8,15,16,23,42], 15	2
[11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90	-1
```
