# Challenge Summary
fizz buzz tree

## Challenge Description
Create a function that takes in a tree as an argument and returns a new tree in the same order with values changed according to Fizz Buzz rules

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a function that takes in a tree as an argument and returns a new tree in the same order
Create a function that takes in a tree as an argument
The tree passed in returns a list of the tree values in order
Pass this list into breadth first which goes top to bottom left to right
Create a new list that is empty
Iterate through the original list that was passed in
	If the remainder of the value divided by 3 or 5 equals zero then the value is divisible
    -iterate through, changing values following fizz buzz rules-
	Append these changed values to the new list
Create a new tree
Iterate through the new list with the changed values
	For each value add to new tree
