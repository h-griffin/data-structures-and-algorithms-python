# Challenge Summary
merge sort blog

## Challenge Description
write a blog explaining each step to a merge sort

## Approach & Efficiency
split the list in half and itterate thorugh each half at the same time. create a variable for each half of the list and another to go thorugh th ewhole list (i .j , k) sort each half and when merging them back together merge one by one.

### Assignment
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

Pseudo Code

ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n <-- arr.length

    if n > 1
      DECLARE mid <-- n/2
      DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
      DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
      // sort the left side
      Mergesort(left)
      // sort the right side
      Mergesort(right)
      // merge the sorted left and right sides together
      Merge(left, right, arr)

ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i <-- 0
    DECLARE j <-- 0
    DECLARE k <-- 0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            arr[k] <-- left[i]
            i <-- i + 1
        else
            arr[k] <-- right[j]
            j <-- j + 1

        k <-- k + 1

    if i = left.length
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left

Sample Arrays
In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]
Implementation
Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
