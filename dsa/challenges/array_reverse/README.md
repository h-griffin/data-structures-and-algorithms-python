### Code Challenge
Reverse an array.


### Feature Tasks
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
Example
```Input	Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

[89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12]	[-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199]	[199, 197, 193, 191, 181, 179, 173, 167, 163, 157, 151, 149, 139, 137, 131, 127, 113, 109, 107, 103, 101, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]
```
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Note: There is no test requirement for Class01. Going forward you will be required to test any code you produce unless otherwise directed by your instructional team.

Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement the same feature with a different methodology. (Hint: what different techniques do you have when working with arrays? Recursion, loops, indexes, modifying the array input directly…)
